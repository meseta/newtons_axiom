## About
This is the source code for my entry to the 72 hour [GMC Jam 7](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/the-brilliant-gmc-jam-7-games-topic.43269/) game jam; the theme was "Newton's Laws of Motion". The released game can be [found on Itch.io](https://meseta.itch.io/axiom)

The jam was an opportunity for me to explore a few topics:
* Steering behavior/Boids
* Procedural generation
* Chunk loading/culling
* Particle trails
* Basic collisions with physics

I'm now open-sourcing the code for educational purposes.
